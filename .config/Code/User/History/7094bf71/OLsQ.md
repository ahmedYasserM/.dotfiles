1. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):

    1. Selects the element immediately following another specific element.

    2. Only targets the single immediate sibling that directly follows.

    3. Syntax: `element1 + element2`

    4. Example: `p + span selects the <span> that immediately follows a <p>`.


2. General Sibling Selector (~):

Selects all elements that are siblings of a specific element and share the same parent, regardless of their order.
Targets all siblings that match the criteria, not necessarily immediately following.
Syntax: element1 ~ element2.
Example: p ~ span selects all <span> elements that follow any <p> within the same parent.
