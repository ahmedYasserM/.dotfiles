#### Vim Way To Deal With Repeation

- Our work is repetitive by nature

- Vim is optimized for repetition

- We can always replay the last change with a single keystroke

---

## The . Command

- The dot command lets us repeat the last change.

- But what is a Change?

- A change could be an action:

  - on individual characters

  - on entire lines

  - or even the whole file

## Modal User Interface?

This means that the result of pressing any key on the keyboard may differ depending on which
mode is active at the time.

---

## VIM Modes :keyboard:

- Normal Mode

- Insert Mode

- Visual Mode

- Command Mode
