- The `http-equiv` attribute is used in the `<meta>` element, which is part of the HTML document. Therefore, it is related to the HTTP headers in the **response message** sent by the server to the client (usually a web browser) when the HTML page is requested and served.

- To clarify further:

  1. **Request Message**: When a client (e.g., a web browser) requests a web page from a server, it sends an HTTP request message to the server. This request message includes information such as the requested URL, headers, and other data needed by the server to process the request.

  2. **Response Message**: After receiving the HTTP request, the server processes it and sends back an HTTP response message to the client. This response message includes the requested HTML page along with other headers and data. The HTML page can contain `<meta>` elements with `http-equiv` attributes to provide specific HTTP headers in the response.

- So, `http-equiv` attributes in the `<meta>` elements of the HTML page allow you to set HTTP headers within the **response message** sent by the server to the client.
