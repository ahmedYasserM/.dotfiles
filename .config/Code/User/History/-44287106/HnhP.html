            <ul>
              <li>Our work is repetitive by nature.</li>
              <li>Vim is optimized for repetition.</li>
              <li>We can always replay the last change with a single keystroke.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              It’s useless unless we learn to craft our actions so that they perform a useful unit of work
              when replayed. Mastering this concept is the key to becoming effective with Vim.

              <li>But what is a Change?</li>
              <li>
                A change could be an action:
                <ol>
                  <li>on individual characters.</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    > do the exercises in file: 1-repeation.md The x command deletes the character under the
                    cursor. When we use the dot command in this context, “repeat last change” tells Vim to
                    delete the character under the cursor
                  </aside>
                  <li>on entire lines.</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    > do the exercises in file: 2-repeation.md The dd command also performs a deletion, but
                    this one acts on the current line as a whole. If we use the dot command after dd, then
                    “repeat last change” instructs Vim to delete the current line
                  </aside>

                  <li>or even the whole file.</li>

                  <aside class="notes">
                    > do the exercises in file: 3-repeation.md Finally, the >G command increases the
                    indentation from the current line until the end of the file. If we follow this command
                    with the dot command, then “repeat last change” tells Vim to increase the indentation
                    level from the current position to the end of the file. In this example, we’ll start with
                    the cursor on the second line to highlight the difference

                <li>Much of the power of Normal mode stems from the way that operator commands can be combined with motions.</li>
