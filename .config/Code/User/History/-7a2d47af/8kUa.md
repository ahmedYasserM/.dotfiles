# HTTP

## HTTP Requests and Responses

- A `client` is a computer making an HTTP request

- A `server` is a computer responding to an HTTP request

- A computer can be a client, a server, both, or neither. "Client" and "server" are just words we use to describe what computers are doing within a communication system.

- Clients send requests and receive responses

- Servers receive requests and send responses
