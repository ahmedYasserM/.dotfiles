# HTTP

## HTTP Requests and Responses

- A `client` is a computer making an HTTP request

- A `server` is a computer responding to an HTTP request

- A computer can be a client, a server, both, or neither. `Client` and `server` are just words we use to describe what computers are doing within a communication system.

- **Clients** send requests and receive responses

- **Servers** receive requests and send responses

- `A` $\to$ `B`

  - computer `A` acting as a client because it sending a http request and receiving a http response

  - computer `B`acting as a server because it sending a http response and receiving a http request
