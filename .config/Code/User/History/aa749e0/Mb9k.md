- The only grammer rule in vim language -> verb + noun

- verbs -> operators 

    y    Yank text (copy)
    d    Delete text and save to register
    c    Delete text, save to register, and start insert mode


- nouns -> motions

    h    Left
    j    Down
    k    Up
    l    Right
    w    Move forward to the beginning of the next word
    }    Jump to the next paragraph
    $    Go to the end of the line
    
- Motions also accept count number as arguments
